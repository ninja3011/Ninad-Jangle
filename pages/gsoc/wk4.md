### Week 4

---

1. **24/06/2021:** 
   * Employed a very implistic permutations algortihm which creates all combinations for scope.
   * I need to make it smart, make sure only the relevant scopes come

2. **25/06/2021:**
   * Researched on clickable buttons
   * There are no buttons in blockly, double-checked
   * How to implement a clickable image in blockly
   * Tried implementing
     - https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/create-custom-blocks/fields/built-in-fields/image#creation
     - But failed, one general opinion I found on the net was the JSON Blocks still hadnâ€™t gotten the logic for an onClick Functionionality set in.
     - Need to see more

3. **26/06/2021:**
   * Took a day off to go on a Trek
4. **27/06/2021:**
   * Rewrote some of the code, In a git error and stuff I used force and some parts of my code got washed out
   * Also, there seem to be conflicts, sorting that out
   * Found the Answer!
     - https://groups.google.com/g/blockly/c/rzcpN8iIrRU
     - Basically using extensions again and using a click handler on the image block.
     - the png acts as a field and we get that field and see click event on that.
