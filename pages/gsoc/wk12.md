1. **19/08/2021:**

   * Discussed further plans with GSoC Mentors
   * Worked on developing [ninadjangle.tech](https://ninadjangle.tech/) for GSoC Documentation

2. **20/08/2021:**
   * Worked on developing  [ninadjangle.tech](https://ninadjangle.tech/)  for GSoC Documentation

5. **23/08/2021:**
   * Started work on coding the MYTH CPU Core on the site.
   * Could not code it cause there was not a way to code multiple precursors and successors to the signal in the block.

6. **24/08/2021:**
   * Added the mulifuntional list block. Using this one can add a lot of different inline blocks and merge in one. 

  
7. **25/08/2021:**
   * Tried coding the CPU again.
   * Got stuck again at the part where there is a ternary inside a statement. 
   * My ternary system does ternary as statement inputs, required solution required a ternary solution which uses value inputs
