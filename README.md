## Work Experience

**Open Source Developer Dr Gayatri Mehta, Mr. Steve Hoover
  Google Summer of Code 2021, FOSSi Foundation June 2021 - Present**
-  Designing a TL-Verilog solution for developers and new entrants to the sphere.
-  Powered by Blockly from Google, it will deliver a simple, concise, and intuitive gateway to Circuit Design.
-  Developed a TL-Verilog Generator in Blockly and developed a dashboard for visualising it in practice.

**Team Leader, Indian Division Representative Dr. Faruk Kazi
  7th Delta Advanced Automation Contest, Delta Electronics May 2021 – July 2021**
-  Designed a solution for a problem faced by the packaging Industry when dealing with varied sized items
such is the case with subscription boxes in the
-  Developed the project through the whole life-cycle from design to modelling to manufacturing and programming of the system.
-  Reworked mechanical and software offsets and achieved an efficient working model.
-  Netoworked and implemented a system using a PLC, Servo Drivers, Machine Vision System, IIOT devices.

**Electronics Head Dr.A.S.Rao
  Society of Robotics and Automation (SRA), VJTI July 2021 – Present**
-  Contributed to peer and senior-junior learning by mentoring juniors and teaching topics as Complimentary
Filters, DH Parameters, two-wheeled self balancing DDRs, Logisim, RISC-V.
-  Currently designing Circuit Design Projects to mentor Juniors for the Summer Mentorship Program of
S.R.A, Eklavya.

## Projects

**RISC-V CPU Core github.com/riscv-cpu-core
  TL-Verilog, riscv-gnu-toolchain, MakerchipIDE May 2021 - June 2021**
-  Tested simple .c programs on the riscv-gnu-toolchain
-  Developed a simple calculator with memory to learn the instructions in TL-Verilog
-  Reverse Engineered and coded a pipelined RV64I core in TL-Verilog
-  There are 6 types of instructions I have implemented: R,I,S,B,U,J
-  Successfully ran the ASM of the same .c programs on the core for testing

**8-Bit Computer github.com/8bitcomputer
  logisim , C May 2020 – July 2020**
-  Successfully developed an 8 bit computer system using basic gates and logic knowledge to recreate chips
using ad-hoc models.
-  Implemented Look ahead adders and efficient instruction routing to deal with timing hazards that prop up
due to signal delays
-  Integrated the said chips in a Harvard architecture to make an operational computer system with an assembly
to code in.
-  Tested and Verified functioning of sequences such as Fibonacci and natural number sequences.

**Vitarana Drone github.com/EYRC-VD1632
  ROS,Gazebo, Python, cv2, cascade classifiers Sept 2020 – March 2021**
-  Implementing a drone solution that can pick and drop off loads autonomously using way point navigation
for disaster management.
-  Embedded software to read QR codes and used cascade classifiers to orient the drones with the parcels and
the platforms.
-  Devised and developed a Scheduling Algorithm to maximise profit of the drone on a round trip.
