### Week 0.2

---

1. **27/05/2021:** 
   * Multiline text is not available as a type in Block Factory but it has been added to the developer docs. Seems like a recent feature, the blockly google groups have people trying to code this on their own.
   * Another source for multiline input in the Blockly core. An undocumented option: 
          - from issue:  https://github.com/google/blockly/issues/3939
          - https://github.com/google/blockly/blob/master/core/field_multilineinput.js
   * Went through learn to react website:

2. **28/05/2021:**
   * React is looking a little less scary now. I guess the more I look at a framework the less scary it looks. I have had a slow start to React, TBH I feel, its like that for most things with me, I spend the first few days just getting a feel for stuff, slow starter. Its fine, language is just a way of saying things, what matters is the logic, and Ill get the hang of the language as I work with it more.
