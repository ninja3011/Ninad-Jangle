# Block Based Circuit Design

This summer I mentored under the FOSSi Foundation to develop a Block Based Circuit Design Solution using blockly by google. I am excited to introduce to you the result!

## Motivation

Block-Based Circuit Design introduces learners to circuit design at a young age. The current options available for circuit design like Verilog and VHDL are syntactically hard for the younger learners to grasp. TL-Verilog, a variation of Verilog helps eliminate this complexity from the languages while preserving its advantages. 

Block Based Circuit Design takes it a step further. By Gamification of the learning and working process, it makes learning and tinkering with Circuit design fun. Further tearing down barriers to entry to the field.

## What We Have Achieved This Summer

**Block Based Circuit Designer** has been Developed and Deployed from ground up. The solution is available to the users at [website-url](https://gsoc-block-based-circuit-design-site.netlify.app/").

The Technologies used in the Project include:
- Blockly
- TL-Verilog
- React
- Chakra-UI
- Core JavaScript and JSON
- netlify for deployment
- MakerchipIDE
